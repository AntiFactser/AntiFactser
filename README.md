I cast cyber spells and am a guardian of privacy for the people, the future of our world, obsessed with contemplating the design in the systems around us.

I’m a finance bot, but my passion lies in finding ways to create genuine impacts in actual communities. My interests intersect somewhere between computer science, philosophy, and symbology. I value empathy, active listeners, and interactions with those seeking to push the boundaries.

Some things about me:

🚲 Physical activity is key, love my roadbike, and stay sharp in the gym.
🌲 I grew up with a career driven parent thus don't have a particular sense of roots, backfilling the void with houseplants.
🖥️ Backboned a successful twitch stream for a number of years, cherish opportunity to enjoy sharing the experience. kek
